/**
 * More info : http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Retrofit/article.html
 * Retrofit is a REST Client for Android and Java by Square.
 * It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
 * In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization.
 * Typically for JSON you use GSon (Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON ),
 * but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols.
 * Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests
